# Dummy Labeling

During the data prep process - Instead of manually drawing bounding boxes, what if I could just verify the results from high-quality models? Say that I'd like to create a dataset to train my object detection model. However, all I have are the images and their corresponding class label (one label per image). Bounding boxes are needed as part of the data cleaning process, but I really don't want to go through all images and draw the boxes myself. I'm cool with verifying existing bounding boxes and their labels, though. So... why don't we do that?

Hang tight; this readme is subject to a major rewrite soon. (After I finish the development, of course)
